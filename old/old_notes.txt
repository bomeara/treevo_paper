###### TWO tests of treevo
#################################################

# Unresolved question: Number of particles? Number of generations?

#########################
### (1) test basic BM
	# fixed sigma square (rate)

	#Two different BM priors: unif with truth at say 25th percentile, rexp with mean not at true value (just to be realistic). Similar for root state.

	
#############################	
### (2) interaction model - repulsion between species with max bound 
	# assume log transformed traits, so no min bound
	# use realistic tree set

# Some models with 
	# no actual repulsion
	# moderate (species cross in trait space) 
	# high (no touching happens). 
# Models vary distance of max to the trait data
	# max is very close (most species bounce off it based on starting values), 
	# max is moderately far (start hitting in last 25% of sim), 
	# very far (never hit)
# Thatâ€™s nine different parameter values, 
	# all of which I guess are scaled effective to the BM rate. 
	# Could do it as six: 
		#1) moderate repulsion, max bound is very close
		#2) moderate repulsion, max bound is moderately close
		#3) moderate repulsion, max bound is very far
		#4) no repulsion, max bound is moderately close
		#5) high repulsion, max bound is moderately close

# 3) Time - autoregressive model with optimum based on a factor that changes through time (like O2 concentration)
 # empirical tree, like in simulations

 # Parameters of the regression: 
	# a single variable function to convert O2 to optimal gill size or whatever
	# strength of pull
	# BM wiggle
	
# abd presumably the tracked env factor will be analyzed many times over
